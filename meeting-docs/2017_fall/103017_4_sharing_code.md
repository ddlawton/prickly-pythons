## Recap of our 5th meeting this semester!
0. Coconut buns from [Happy Buns](http://goodfoodfinderaz.com/find-good-food/happy-buns-asian-bakery/), Halloween chocolates and coffee!
1. Karen reminded everyone of the homepage and that next meeting will most likely be focused on using SQL.
2. Karen did a step-by-step demonstration of how to create a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and start using it.
3. Karen explained how to check, install and update package versions with conda and pip.
4. Joe showed us how to overcome the issue of python 2 code that doesn't work in python 3 and vice versa, using the [fish package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fish/) as an example.

A doodle will be sent out this week to reconsider the time for remaining meetings this semester.
