## Recap of our 8th and last meeting this semester!
0. Coconut buns and coffee+tea
1. Shanshan Yang gave a presentation on doing statistics with python:<br>
  1.1 Introducing ANOVA = analysis of variance, using the scipy module.<br>
  1.2 Calculating p-values, using the scipy module.<br>
  1.3 Comparing means using the [Tukey's range test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey%27s_range_test) with the statsmodels module.<br>
  1.4 Ordinary least squares (ols) on linear models with the statsmodels module.<br>
  1.5 And finally the [T-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) to get a p-values, using the scipy module.<br>
2. Shanshan also took us further into classification of important features with:<br>
  2.1 How to use pandas to explore data and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) to visualize it.<br>
  2.2 Using the [random forest classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) to select important factors and search for correlations, using the sklearn module.<br>
  2.3 Finally how to use the learning Support vector machines (SVMs) functionality of the sklearn module.<br>

And I left out some of the funtions presented, so please take a look at Shanshan's information-rich notes, [here](http://prickly-pythons.github.io/python_code/A.anova.html) and [here](http://prickly-pythons.github.io/python_code/B.classification.html).
