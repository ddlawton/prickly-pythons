## Recap of our third meeting this semester!
0. Coconut buns from [Happy Buns](http://goodfoodfinderaz.com/find-good-food/happy-buns-asian-bakery/), chocolates and coffee!
1. Karen reminded everyone of the homepage where you can find topics for future meetings and links to previous code presented.
2. Karen introduced numpy.loadtxt() and numpy.genfromtxt() as well as pandas dataframes for structuring data.
3. Duho (astronomy grad student) gave an example of using the ascii() object from the astropy module, with options to read in data from big galaxy surveys fast.
4. Lucia (astronomy grad student) showed us how she saves/loads large arrays of modeling results as dictionaries with the numpy.save()/numpy.load() functions.
5. We had discussion on which methods are faster than others, in particular which methods can use C language to read data faster than the python engine would.
