## Recap of our 6th meeting this semester!
0. Honey cake from Joe('s mom) and almond cookies from [Happy Buns](http://goodfoodfinderaz.com/find-good-food/happy-buns-asian-bakery/) and coffee!
1. Sean Bryan gave a jupyter notebook and directly-in-terminal presentation on:
  1.1 Working with large arrays in pandas, to for example group values by another quantity or visualize the data fast.
  1.2 Creating a SQL database from a basic csv (=comma-separated-values) text file.
  1.3 Making queries in the created SQL database using tools in the pandas module.
  
It was decided to move the next meeting (Nov 27) to a Tuesday (Nov 28), same time, such that people on extended Thanksgiving vacation can attend.
