# Monday, Jan 25, Notes

## Recap of our 6th meeting
We discussed anaconda as a way of installing python + packages. Most of the audience already use anaconda and there was a general agreement that it's easy to use AND that there is no real reason to install python v3 at the moment. Then Karen went over simple plotting and subplotting with matplotlib including how to show a jpeg/png image in the plot figure. The code she presented, one_plot.py and multi_plot.py are avaliable in the code-templates folder. Alejandro (amloren1) then gave a walkthrough for Tkinter on how to create an interactive gui object. His code is also in the code-templates folder.
Sean also brought attention to the DesertPy group that meet on Wed and Sat: http://www.meetup.com/Phoenix-Python-Meetup-Group/
