## Recap of our 4th meeting this semester!
First of all: Marble cake!

This meeting was focused on how to make your program modular and how to reload changes made in modules and submodules fast. 
Francis Duplessis and Karen went trough general examples of this and we had discussions on the good and bad sides of each approach. Code presented during the meeting will be available here: https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/tree/master/code_from_meetings/making_modules/structure_example

One important take-away is how to set up your python for automatic reloading of your code every time you call a function from it. 
This is described in very few words here: http://www.keybits.net/2014/01/configure-autoreload-for-ipython/.

Also, Seth brought to our attention the public python tutorials by JWST group: https://github.com/spacetelescope/JWSTUserTraining2016
Anyone starting in python could benefit greatly from checking out their ipython notebooks, starting with "Day_Zero_Notebooks".

Remember to put topic requests for next meeting in two weeks here: https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/issues/9
We are leaning towards these two topics: "ways to set up your websites" or "subprocessing in python".
