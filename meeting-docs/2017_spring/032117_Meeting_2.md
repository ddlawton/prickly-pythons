## Recap of our 3rd meeting this semester!

First of all: Cookies from sprouts!<br>
This meeting was focused on how to make different types of plots in python and setting the plotting parameters. 
Karen went through examples of the following which can all be found as ipython notebooks** or pdf files 
[here](https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/blob/master/code_from_meetings/making_plots/).
- Making a simple plot in object-oriented way
- Adding an extra y-axis to the plot
- Making subplots (including bar plots and histograms)
- Transparency
- Saving plots

Then, Seth talked about the matplotlibrc file which can control your default plot settings. 
He used a matplotlibrc file from [this github site](https://github.com/spacetelescope/pylunch/tree/master/4-matplotlib) which you can download and edit to your likings. 
His recommended way of setting the defaults is to:

Create a user specific default file
   - in your home directory > mkdir .matplotlib
   - put file called "matplotlibrc" in this directory

Finally, Cassie Collins gave an example of loading data from a spreadsheet as as dataframe (using the pandas module) 
and plotting specific columns. The code** she presented together with the data and image can be found 
[here](https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/tree/master/code_from_meetings/making_plots/crater_example). 

** about Jupyter notebooks: Github will render notebooks, but you can also run them by cloning this repository, 
navigating to [this folder](https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/tree/master/code_from_meetings/making_plots/crater_example) 
in your terminal and typing:
```
jupyter notebook
```
which will open up a browser.
