## Recap of our 2nd meeting this semester!
First of all: cookies

Today was an improvised python Q&A on anything that bothered people regarding installation and basic python setup/skills.

Important points that came up during the meeting:
- If you only want the bare minimum to get started with python in your terminal (or command prompt on Windows), you can download and install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html), but it will *not* contain ipython. 
- When installing python via anaconda, it will ask for permission to add paths to your terminal configuration script (typically saved as ~/.bash_profile). It's a good idea to allow anaconda to do this, because then you can type 'python' or 'ipython' (or the very useful package installers 'conda' and 'pip') in your terminal and start them directly. Otherwise you would have to set up aliases manually in your bash or tcsh configuration script.
- An alternative to sublime and canopy that we discussed last time, you can use the following to write your python code:
 - [atom](https://atom.io/) text editor
 - [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) text editor
 - [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) way of typing, running and saving your code in a browser window (good for presentations - I used it last time)
- Checking version of python and packages
 - by starting python in your terminal, it will always print your current version of python (e.g. 2.7.13)
 - if you want to check where python is located physically on your computer, type 'which python' in unix (=mac/linux) or 'where python' in Windows
 - to check the version of a specific package, like numpy, open python and type:
    - import numpy
    - print(numpy.__version__)
  
Let us know at the next meeting (Mar 21) if you have any questions!
