## Recap of our 4th meeting this semester!
First of all: cookies!

This meeting was focused on how to organize your code and make it modular.

>>> Organizing your code
Karen went trough a short presentation on clean coding based on the book [Clean Coding](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) by Robert C. Martin.

>>> Making your code modular
Karen showed some general examples of this and we had discussions on each. 

>>> Reloading your code
One important take-away is how to set up your python for automatic reloading of your code every time you call a function from it. 
This is described in very few words here: http://www.keybits.net/2014/01/configure-autoreload-for-ipython/.
