## Recap of our first meeting this semester!
First of all: cookies

1. Installing python: It is recommended that you use one of the following:
  - anaconda: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
  - canopy: https://store.enthought.com/downloads/#default
  - in addition, the sublime text program is great for making python scripts: https://www.sublimetext.com/
2. Using Github as a knowledge forum:
  - Our group page: http://prickly-pythons.github.io/ - here you can find time/place for next meetings
  - Other places to seek knowledge:
    - facebook group: Python users in Astronomy Facebook http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/Astronomy+Organizations+on+Facebook
    - the DesertPy group: http://www.meetup.com/Phoenix-Python-Meetup-Group/
    - ASU research computing: https://researchcomputing.asu.edu/
    - Python in Astronomy 2017 in Europe: http://openastronomy.org/pyastro/2017/
    - stay tuned for next dotastronomy meeting in the US in June (check on twitter/facebook): https://rjsmethurst.github.io/dotastro_holding/
3. Python basics: Karen went through the workflow of python: different variable types, arrays, matrices and plots. The ipython notebooks and pdf version can be found here: https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/tree/master/code_from_meetings/intro
  - if you want to run the notebooks, download the folder (or clone the repository) and type in a terminal in the same directory: *jupyter notebook*
4. Other:
We settled on topics for the next weeks, see them [here](http://prickly-pythons.github.io/) and email Karen if you have more topics on your mind!

Next time is March 7 with a "baby-python" session for those not going away in spring break and interested in learning more basic python skills.
