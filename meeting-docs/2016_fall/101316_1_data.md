## Recap of our second meeting this semester!
0. Cookies from sprouts!
This meeting was focused on how to make python read in your data/models of different format and do it well! 
Karen went through examples of the following which can all be found as ipython notebooks or pdf files [here](https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/tree/master/code_from_meetings/reading_data).
1. Loading text (ascii format) files
  - with numpy.loadtxt(), putting the data into a numpy array
  - with numpy.genfromtxt(), putting the data into a numpy structure
  - with pandas.read_table(), putting the data into a pandas dataframe
  - how to plot two columns from the above python data files.
2. Loading fits files with astropy.io.fits.open()
3. Saving the data in python format to read later:
  - save numpy array with np.save(), will save python-formatted file
  - save numpy array with cPickle.dump(), will save binary-formatted file
  - save dataframe with to_pickle() attribute

Remember to put topic request for next meeting in two weeks here: https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/issues/9
