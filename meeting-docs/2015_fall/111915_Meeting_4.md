# Thursday, Nov 19, Notes

## Recap of our 5th meeting!
We had a short 1 hour meeting today, focused on integrating and fitting functions or data points.

## Agenda
0. More Halloween candy!
1. Example of integration by Karen: Integrating a discrete set of data points (with simps in scipy) or a function (with quad in scipy). During that process, we also looked at different ways of fitting a curve to data points (curve_fit from scipy.optimize and numpy.polyfit). <br /> 

## Next meeting!!
- Who's baking?!
- Possible topics: multi-processing (parallelization to reduce execution time)
