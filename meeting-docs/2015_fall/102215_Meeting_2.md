# Thursday, Sep 24, Notes

## Recap of our 3rd meeting!

## Agenda
0. Swedish christmas bread!
1. Introduction to Matplotlib by John West: This presentation started out with simple plotting of y vs. x, followed by scatter plots, histograms, double axes and customized subplots with help from Boom. Throughout John also showed quite a bit of object-oriented plotting so we got a thorough warm-up for a future session on that.
2. Example of astropy-use by Karen: reading a fits file and making a contour plot from it. With the help of Abhij and Boom, we added a colorbar. Special attention was called to World Coordinate transformations with WCSaxes: http://wcsaxes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html
4. Break-out session, where people worked on their own problems and talked about installing packages with pip/anaconda.
5. Other: We came up with some more topics that could be covered in future sessions (see the 'Topic Request' Issue) 

## Next meeting!!
- Who's baking?
- Possible topics: more object-oriented plotting; fitting; multi-processing (parallelization to reduce execution time); any other topic posted in Issues: Topic Requests.
