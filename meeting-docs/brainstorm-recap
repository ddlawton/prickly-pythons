Recap of our brainstorming!

¡¡ATTENTION: FIRST MEETING!!
The purpose of the first meeting will be to ensure that everybody has python installed correctly and an account on Github. If you already have both, you’re still very welcome to come and help others. We want to avoid technical issues later.
When: Next week around lunch time, a doodle will be sent out soon so stay tuned!
Where: Most likely ISTB4

Why Github?
Github is a great place to build and develop code, in particular if you are several collaborators on the same project. We’re going to use Github for sharing bits of python code and as a forum/chat for asking questions. That way there will be no endless email chains and everybody can learn from each others problems.

Setting up an account is super-easy, and later we will invite you to a python group (Bo0om is working on it):

Below is a short summary of what we talked about and agreed upon today, going through the agenda from this morning.
1. Python experience
Among the 9 of us, there was a large range from just touching upon IDL (switching from IDL/matlab) to >4y experience. We agreed that the meetings should take this range into account, not to discourage/bore new OR old pythons.
2. What would you like to learn
The meetings will be focused on the most active questions/issues on Github, so where people have actual problems. Can for example be packages, functions or more general topics (like healpix) where people can join whatever language they use.
3. Format
1 weekly/bi-weekly meeting around lunch, the rest on Github
4. Notification
There will be an email sent out to SESEALL for the time of the first meeting, but then communication will move to Github
5. Other
Cake is on.
