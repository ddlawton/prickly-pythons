## Recap of our 3rd meeting this semester!
0. Cookies from sprouts!
This meeting was focused on how to make different types of plots in python and setting the plotting parameters. 
Karen went through examples of the following which can all be found as ipython notebooks or pdf files [here](https://github.com/prickly-pythons/prickly-pythons/tree/master/code_from_meetings/making_plots).
1. Making a simple plot in object-oriented way
2. Adding an extra y-axis to the plot
3. Making subplots (including bar plots and histograms)
Then, Seth talked about the matplotlibrc file which can control your default plot settings. He used a matplotlibrc file from [this github site](https://github.com/spacetelescope/pylunch/tree/master/4-matplotlib).
Finally, we looked at a cool video that Sean made using [healpy](http://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) of a satellite mapping the sky.
