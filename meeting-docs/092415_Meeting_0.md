# Thursday, Sep 24, Notes


## Recap of our first meeting!

### FIRST MEETING
The purpose of the first meeting will be to ensure that everybody has python installed correctly and an account on Github. If you already have both, youâ€™re still very welcome to come and help others. We want to avoid technical issues later.

1. Anyone not on the SESEALL mailing list?

  - the Gitter chat (download stand-alone app here: https://gitter.im/apps)
